# best Python courses
Whether you have just started learning to code or are a computer science graduate, if you are interested in learning Python then you have come to the right place. In this article, I am going to share my favorite online courses to **learn Python in 2024.**

This list is made up of the best and highest-quality Python courses offered by [Udemy](https://medium.com/javarevisited/10-best-python-3-courses-on-udemy-ddd4e3ec5dbf), [Coursera](https://medium.com/javarevisited/10-best-python-certification-courses-from-coursera-4576890eb6b3), Pluralsight, CodeCademy, ZTM Academy, Educative, One Month, and other reputable online learning platforms which I have chosen after spending a year and a half researching countless [books](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/07/top-5-books-to-learn-python-in-2019.html), [free courses](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/12/10-free-python-courses-for-programmers.html), [online training](https://dev.to/javinpaul/7-python-online-courses-for-beginners-and-intermediate-programmers-1h4k), [websites](https://medium.com/javarevisited/10-free-python-tutorials-and-courses-from-google-microsoft-and-coursera-for-beginners-96b9ad20b4e6), articles, and tutorials.

Python is one of the most popular programming languages and it's used in many domains, such as web development, automation, data science, and machine learning to name a few.

In recent years, Python has also become the default language for [data science and machine learning](https://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/03/top-5-data-science-and-machine-learning-online-courses-to-learn-online.html) projects, and that's another reason why many experienced programmers are learning Python in 2024.

It's also one of the top languages on my list of [programming languages to learn in](http://www.java67.com/2017/12/10-programming-languages-to-learn-in.html) 2024. But, for all its power and flexibility, Python is still a very simple language to learn and often touted as an ideal programming language for beginners.

If you are a Java or a web developer using [JavaScript](http://www.java67.com/2018/04/top-5-free-javascript-courses-to-learn.html) to create web applications, it still pays off to learn Python because becoming a [polyglot programmer](http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2014/01/10-tips-to-improve-programming-skill-become-better-programmer.html), i.e. learning more than one programming language, not only improves your knowledge and experience but also makes you more attractive to employers.

If you are thinking of learning a new programming language then Python is a good choice, particularly if you are looking to move towards a lucrative career path of data science or machine learning.

In the past, I have shared my thoughts about [*why a beginner should choose Java over Python*](http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2013/11/java-vs-python-which-programming-laungage-to-learn-first.html) when starting programming but things have come a long way since them.

In recent years, Python has grown significantly, which has resulted in more and more opportunities for Python developers. I have also shared a complete [**Python Developer RoadMap**](https://medium.com/javarevisited/the-2022-python-programmer-roadmap-bafb365071a3), which you can also see after reading this article.
